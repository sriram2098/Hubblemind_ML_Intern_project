# Predicting Amazon's Stock Price and Trading Volumes

This project aims to predict Amazon's stock price and trading volumes using historical market data and machine learning techniques. By leveraging various models and data analysis methods, this project provides insights into stock trends and helps forecast future price movements and trading activity.

## **Abstract:**

This project focuses on predicting Amazon's stock price and trading volumes using historical data and machine learning techniques. The process begins with data collection, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations in the stock market. Various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are employed to build predictive models. The models are evaluated based on performance metrics to assess their accuracy in forecasting future stock prices and trading volumes. This project demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches in financial forecasting, aiding in informed investment decisions.

This abstract highlights the project's goals, methodology, and outcomes in a succinct manner.

# Workflow for Predicting Amazon's Stock Price and Trading Volumes

### 1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather historical stock data for Amazon, including price and trading volumes.
   - Data source: [e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage API, or CSV file].

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing data (if any) and clean the dataset.
   - Convert date fields to appropriate formats.
   - Normalize/scale data if necessary for machine learning models.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize trends, patterns, and correlations in stock price and trading volumes.
   - Use statistical measures to summarize data insights.
   - Plot time series graphs, correlation heatmaps, and other relevant visualizations.

### 4. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create new features based on historical data (e.g., moving averages, volatility, etc.).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

### 5. **Model Development**
   - Build and train machine learning models using algorithms such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forest
   - Fine-tune models by adjusting hyperparameters.

### 6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
     - R-squared (R²)
   - Compare different models to identify the best-performing one.

### 7. **Prediction**
   - Use the trained models to predict future stock prices and trading volumes.
   - Visualize the predictions vs. actual stock data to assess performance.

### 8. **Documentation**
   - Document the entire process in a Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.
   - Explain the methodology, results, and insights.

### Future Work:
- Fine-tuning models for improved accuracy
- Testing additional machine learning algorithms
- Incorporating external factors like market sentiment or news data.
