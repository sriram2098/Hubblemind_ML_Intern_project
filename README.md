# Predicting Amazon's Stock Price and Trading Volumes

This project aims to predict Amazon's stock price and trading volumes using historical market data and machine learning techniques. By leveraging various models and data analysis methods, this project provides insights into stock trends and helps forecast future price movements and trading activity.

### Key Components:
- **Data Collection**: Historical stock price and volume data for Amazon were gathered.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzed trends, correlations, and patterns within the dataset.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Applied algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to build predictive models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models based on accuracy and performance metrics like RMSE.
- **Documentation**: Full project workflow, from data processing to model implementation, is documented for reproducibility and understanding.

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model development
- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and documentation

### Future Work:
- Fine-tuning models for improved accuracy
- Testing additional machine learning algorithms
- Incorporating external factors like market sentiment or news data.
