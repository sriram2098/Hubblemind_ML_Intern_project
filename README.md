# Predicting Amazon's Stock Price and Trading Volumes

This project aims to predict Amazon's stock price and trading volumes using historical market data and machine learning techniques. By leveraging various models and data analysis methods, this project provides insights into stock trends and helps forecast future price movements and trading activity.

##**Abstract:**

This project focuses on predicting Amazon's stock price and trading volumes using historical data and machine learning techniques. The process begins with data collection, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations in the stock market. Various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are employed to build predictive models. The models are evaluated based on performance metrics to assess their accuracy in forecasting future stock prices and trading volumes. This project demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches in financial forecasting, aiding in informed investment decisions.

This abstract highlights the project's goals, methodology, and outcomes in a succinct manner.
